        This function should perform a probabilistic inference query that
        returns the factor:

        P(queryVariables | evidenceDict)

        It should perform inference by interleaving joining on a variable
        and eliminating that variable, in the order of variables according
        to eliminationOrder.  See inferenceByEnumeration for an example on
        how to use these functions.

        You need to use joinFactorsByVariable to join all of the factors 
        that contain a variable in order for the autograder to 
        recognize that you performed the correct interleaving of 
        joins and eliminates.

        If a factor that you are about to eliminate a variable from has 
        only one unconditioned variable, you should not eliminate it 
        and instead just discard the factor.  This is since the 
        result of the eliminate would be 1 (you marginalize 
        all of the unconditioned variables), but it is not a 
        valid factor.  So this simplifies using the result of eliminate.

        The sum of the probabilities should sum to one (so that it is a true 
        conditional probability, conditioned on the evidence).

        bayesNet:         The Bayes Net on which we are making a query.
        queryVariables:   A list of the variables which are unconditioned

        eliminationOrder: The order to eliminate the variables in.

        Hint: BayesNet.getAllCPTsWithEvidence will return all the Conditional 
        Probability Tables even if an empty dict (or None) is passed in for 
        evidenceDict. In this case it will not specialize any variable domains
